# Portfolio Management System - Technical Solution

## Problem Statement
Create a Portfolio management system that can:
- Track a collection of stocks with their current prices
- Maintain target allocations for each stock
- Calculate rebalancing trades to achieve target allocations

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### 1. Design Patterns Used

#### Builder Pattern
- Implemented for both Stock and Portfolio creation to handle complex object construction
- Allows for future extensibility of object attributes and validation rules
- Separates construction from representation

#### Observer Pattern (Price Updates)
- StockPriceService acts as the subject
- Stock objects are observers that get updated with new prices
- Decouples price fetching from stock management

#### Strategy Pattern (Future Extensibility)
- Portfolio rebalancing algorithm is encapsulated
- Allows for different rebalancing strategies in the future

### 2. Code Organization

The solution follows a clean architecture approach with:
- `models/` - Core domain models (Stock, Trade, Portfolio)
- `services/` - External integrations (Yahoo Finance API)
- Clear separation of concerns between data models and business logic

### 3. Key Features

#### Real-time Price Updates
- Integration with Yahoo Finance API
- Robust error handling for API failures
- Asynchronous price updates possible in future iterations

#### Portfolio Rebalancing
- Calculates optimal trades to achieve target allocation
- Considers current market prices
- Minimizes number of trades needed

### 4. Future Extensibility

The solution is designed to be extended with:
- Additional stock data providers
- Different rebalancing strategies
- Transaction cost optimization
- Risk metrics and analysis
- Historical performance tracking

### 5. Testing Considerations

While not implemented in the 3-hour timeframe, the code is structured to be testable:
- Models are isolated and stateless where possible
- External dependencies (Yahoo Finance) are abstracted
- Clear interfaces between components

### 6. Production Readiness

The code includes:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Type hints for better maintainability
- Documentation and docstrings

## Development History

### Initial Requirements
- Original task: Create a Portfolio class with stocks and rebalancing functionality
- Time constraint: 3 hours
- Focus on maintainability and professional organization

### Evolution of Solution

1. First Iteration:
   - Question: "How could I improve the initial implementation?"
   - Changes Made:
     - Split code into multiple files
     - Added real-time price fetching
     - Improved project structure

2. Second Iteration:
   - Question: "Need to update dependencies, add solution documentation, and implement design patterns"
   - Changes Made:
     - Updated yfinance to latest version
     - Added comprehensive documentation
     - Implemented Builder pattern for Stock and Portfolio
     - Added detailed technical documentation

### Key Decisions

1. Use of Builder Pattern:
   - Chosen for better object construction
   - Enables future extensibility
   - Improves code readability
   - Enforces validation during construction

2. Project Structure:
   - Modular approach with separate concerns
   - Clear separation of models and services
   - Easy to extend and maintain

3. Documentation:
   - Comprehensive README for quick start
   - Detailed SOLUTION.md for technical review
   - Inline documentation and type hints
